	 * 2) States are numbered starting from 0 to #states. In order to change state, function #changeState(uint8_t)
	 *    takes an int argument and this is the state id determined by it's position in provided var-arg argument.
	 *    For example:
	 *    - if you have created the driver with 5 states, in order to change to last one execute #changeState(4)
	 *    - in order to switch to predefined noop-state execute: #change(STATE_NOOP)
	 * 3) State machine starts always from 0 state, also reseting switches to this state.
